# Simple-Twitch-Desktop

A lightweight alternative to the official twitch desktop app that has integrated the [FrankerFaceZ](https://github.com/FrankerFaceZ/FrankerFaceZ) extension.

**This app is only meant for watching streams and does not provide integration for the game library.**

## Additional options
With the `Alt` key the menu bar can be made visible at any time. There you can find options like reload the site or go forward and back.
